In the Foreword (previous to the actual book) one guy says that he would advice regarding the Bogle's book:

* He would place more emphasis on the value of international diversification (especially exposure to emerging markets)
* He would limit holdings of bonds to full-faith-and-credit issues of US government. This because exposure to credit undermines the very reason for holding bonds (he mentions the experience of 2008 crisis)

He also recommend some books afer reading this one.

He talks good about Vanguard (Jack Bogle's mutual fund) and TIAA - CREF
