# On Simplicity

Never underrate either the majesty of simplicity or its proven effectiveness as a long -term strategy for productive investing. Simplicity is the master key to financial success.

**To earn the highest of returns that are realistically possible, you should invest with simplicity**

What, then, is the optimal method of approaching the 100 percent target and accumulating a substantialinvestment account?&#x20;

Rely on the ordinary virtues that intelligent, balanced human beings have relied on for centuries: common sense, thrift, realistic expectations, patience, and perseverance.

To accomplish simplicity:

* The simplest of all approaches is to invest solely in a single balanced market index fund — just one fund. (An indexed portfolio is one which its stocks and bonds are not actively managed but simply represent a broad cross section of the entire US stock market and bond market. Over the past half - century, such a fund would have captured 98 percent of the rate of return of the combined stock and bond markets. A managed fund tend to be costly)
* If you want to control your investment balance then the simplest approach regarding stocks would be to invest in a single equity index fund.

There is an interesting "Ten years" note on page 155, that says it was better to invest in the balanced market index fund than in an all equity index fund. So seems that my best option is to invest in a balanced market index fund.

The author recommends explicitly an all - index - fund approach. If you don't want that he recommends 8 rules for capitalizing the advantages of index funds:

1. Select low-cost funds: The first thing to look at is the expense ratio
2. Consider Carefully the Added Costs of Advice: The least costly way to own mutual funds is buying no-load funds, that is those without personal guidance. \
   \
   Also beware of apparently no-load funds that charge a 12b - 1 fee (used by them among other things, to promote sales). \
   \
   Also beware of wrap accounts, packages of mutual funds assembled. They are usuarlly expensive.\

3. Do Not Overrate Past Fund Performance: However here is important to take into account that:\
   \
   \- Funds with unusually high expenses are likely to underperform appropriate market indexes\
   \
   \- Funds with past relative returns that have been substantially superior to the returns of an appropriate market index will regress toward, and usually below, the market mean over time
4. Use Past Performance to Determine Consistency and Risk
5. Beware of Stars\
   \
   Seek good managers if you will, but rely on their professionalism, experience, and steadfastness\
   rather than on their stardom. Also beware of star systems.
6. Beware of Asset Size\
   \
   Avoid large fund organizations that \
   (1) have no history of closing funds — that is, terminating the offering of their shares — to new investors, or \
   (2) seem willing to let their funds grow, irrespective of their investment goals, to seemingly infi nite size, beyond their power to differentiate their investment results from the crowd\
   \
   Excessive size can, and probably will, kill any possibility of investment excellence. The record is clear that, for the overwhelming majority of funds, the best years come when they are small
7. Don ’ t Own Too Many Funds\
   \
   Per the author: A single ready - made balanced index fund — holding 65 percent stocks and 35 percent bonds, as shown in my earlier example — can meet the needs of many investors. It is generally unnecessary to go much beyond four or five equity funds. In my case a single one would be enough.\
   \
   For the author the international component of a portfolio shouldn't be more than 20% of the equity position
