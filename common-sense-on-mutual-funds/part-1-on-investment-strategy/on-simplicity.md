# On Simplicity

Never underrate either the majesty of simplicity or its proven effectiveness as a long -term strategy for productive investing. Simplicity is the master key to financial success.

**To earn the highest of returns that are realistically possible, you should invest with simplicity**

What, then, is the optimal method of approaching the 100 percent target and accumulating a substantialinvestment account?&#x20;

Rely on the ordinary virtues that intelligent, balanced human beings have relied on for centuries: common sense, thrift, realistic expectations, patience, and perseverance.

To accomplish simplicity:

* The simplest of all approaches is to invest solely in a single balanced market index fund â€” just one fund. (An indexed portfolio is one which its stocks and bonds are not actively managed but simply represent a broad cross section of the entire US stock market and bond market. Over the past half - century, such a fund would have captured 98 percent of the rate of return of the combined stock and bond markets. A managed fund tend to be costly)
* If you want to control your investment balance then the simplest approach regarding stocks would be to invest in a single equity index fund.

There is an interesting "Ten years" note on page 155, that says it was better to invest in the balanced market index fund than in an all equity index fund. So seems that my best option is to invest in a balanced market index fund.

The author recommends explicitly an all - index - fund approach.
