# On the Nature of Returns

Here he does an analysis based on the Terminal P/E and the Total Stock Market Return (called occam's razor) (84 pdf) (P/E is the price-earnings ratio, that is the valuations that investors were willing to pay for $ 1 of earnings)

Long - term investment returns are conventionally measured by market indexes tracking the broad U.S. stock and bond markets

Basically the Occam's razor method used by the author is based on his conviction that the short term returns are unpredictable, but with long-term performance you can at least do a careful examination of the past returns and establish some probabilities about the prospective parameters of return.

In the long term investments returns conform to the fundamentals:

* Dividend yields
* Earnings growth

It seems that the fundamentals correspond to the sum of both values (?)

Two types of corporate earnings:

* Operating earnings
* Reported earnings (operating earnings minus/plus, almost always minus, write-downs) that account for investment losses)

Occam's Razor theory: These three variables determine stock market returns over the long term

* The dividend yield at the time of initial investment
* The subsequent rate of growth in earnings
* The change in the price â€“ earnings ratio during the period of investment
