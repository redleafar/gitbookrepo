# On the Nature of Returns

Here he does an analysis based on the Terminal P/E and the Total Stock Market Return (called occam's razor) (P/E is the price-earnings ratio, that is the valuations that investors were willing to pay for $ 1 of earnings)

Long - term investment returns are conventionally measured by market indexes tracking the broad U.S. stock and bond markets

Basically the Occam's razor method used by the author is based on his conviction that the short term returns are unpredictable, but with long-term performance you can at least do a careful examination of the past returns and establish some probabilities about the prospective parameters of return.

In the long term investments returns conform to the fundamentals:

* Dividend yields
* Earnings growth

It seems that the fundamentals correspond to the sum of both values (?)

Two types of corporate earnings:

* Operating earnings
* Reported earnings (operating earnings minus/plus, almost always minus, write-downs) that account for investment losses)

Occam's Razor theory: These three variables determine all of the stock market returns over the long term

* The dividend yield at the time of initial investment (known quantity)
* The subsequent rate of growth in earnings (relatively predictable within fairly narrow parameters)
* The change in the price â€“ earnings ratio during the period of investment (highly speculative)

Total return is the sum of the three factors. The analysis relies on nominal returns because it's harder to calculate real returns and the nomital values are more accurate.

The first two are a measure of the two investment fundamentals. The third one is a measure of speculation, a barometer of the investor sentiment.

He used a matrix to estimate the values but later used a model.

Regarding bonds past returns, unlike stocks, are devoid of meaning when forecasting future returns.
