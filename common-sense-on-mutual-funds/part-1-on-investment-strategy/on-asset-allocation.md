# On Asset Allocation

For nearlly all investors, the principal asset classes of choice boil down to common stocks (for maximum total return), bonds (for reasonable income), and cash reserves (for stability of principal). Each differs in risk: stocks are the most volatile, bonds are less so, and the nominal value of cash reserves is inviolable.

Modern Portfolio theory:

Investors almost universally accept it. It is based on developing investment portfolios that seek returns that optimize the investor's willingness to assume risk. Risk is defined in terms of short-term fluctuations in expected value.

In its most comprehensive form, modern portfolio theory dictates that portfolio composition should include all liquid asset classes â€” not only U.S. stocks, bonds, and cash reserves, but international investments, short positions, foreign exchange, and various curios (gold, for example) from the financial marketplace.

The author focus on stocks and bonds.

* Short term bonds are relatively insensitive to interest rate fluctuations, long-bonds are hugely sensitive.&#x20;
* Most of the examples in the book are based on intermediate-term and long-term bonds.

The simple guideline of the author:

* Two-thirds in stocks, one-third in bonds.

Four dimensions of investing:

* Return
* Risk
* Cost
* Time

With a longer time horizon you can afford to take more risk than if it is short and vice versa.
