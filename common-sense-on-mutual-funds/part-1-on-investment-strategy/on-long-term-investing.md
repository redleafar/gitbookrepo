# On Long Term Investing

The historical data supports one conclusion with unusual force: To invest with success you must be a long-term investor.

No guarantee that these patterns of the past, will prevail in the future, but a study of the past, accompanied by a self - administered dose of common sense, is the intelligent investor â€™ s best recourse&#x20;

Short - term investment strategies are inherently dangerous

Elements of investing that are within our power to control: risk, cost, and time

Stocks have provided the highest rate of return among the major categories of financial assets: stocks, bonds, U.S. Treasury bills, and gold, from 1802 to 2008 (around 7.0% anual return).

These long - term data cover solely the financial markets of the United States. (Most studies show that stocks in other nations have provided lower returns and far higher risks.)

Historically the bonds rate of return are less (around 3.5%) and more variable than stocks. Because of compound interest in a long period the difference is very very big.

Interestingly because of the 2008 crisis the rate from 1999 to 2009 for stocks was around 6.5. For bonds from 1997 to 2008 it was 6.2. This contrast provides yet one more testament, if such be needed, to the importance of balancing an investment program between stocks and bonds

The longer the time horizon, the less the variability in average annual returns

The risk is the possibility that, in the long run, stock returns will be terrible: This comment provide a healthy reminder of the uncertainty of future returns in the financial markets. But they hardly vitiate my central message: Focusing on the long term is far superior to focusing on the short term. It is a lesson too few investors have learned.

* Although changes in the rate of inflation from period to period have done little to alter the real rate of returns in the stock market, they have had a profound impact on the real returns provided by bonds. The historical record indicates that investors have often failed to anticipate rapid inflation
* "New" types of U.S. Treasury bonds that obviate two of the traditional risks of bonds:&#x20;
  * Zero coupon bonds
  * Inflation - hedge bonds
* Likely, future returns on long - term Treasurys will fall in the range of 4 percent to 5 percent (this is part of a "Ten years later" analysis done in page 59).
* In the short run, stocks are riskier than bonds, in the long long run bonds are riskier than stocks if risk is the chance of failing to earn a real return over the long term.&#x20;
* However Bonds as insurance against the possibility of short - term, or even extended, weakness in stocks, then, long - term investors should also include bonds in their portfolios.
