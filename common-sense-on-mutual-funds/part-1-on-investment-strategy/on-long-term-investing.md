# On Long Term Investing

The historical data supports one conclusion with unusual force: To invest with success you must be a long-term investor.

No guarantee that these patterns of the past, will prevail in the future, but a study of the past, accompanied by a self - administered dose of common sense, is the intelligent investor â€™ s best recourse&#x20;

Short - term investment strategies are inherently dangerous

Elements of investing that are within our power to control: risk, cost, and time

Stocks have provided the highest rate of return among the major categories of financial assets: stocks, bonds, U.S. Treasury bills, and gold, from 1802 to 2008 (around 7.0% anual return).

These long - term data cover solely the financial markets of the United States. (Most studies show that stocks in other nations have provided lower returns and far higher risks.)

Historically the bonds rate of return are less (around 3.5%) and more variable than stocks. Because of compound interest in a long period the difference is very very big.

Interestingly because of the 2008 crisis the rate from 1999 to 2009 for stocks was around 6.5. For bonds from 1997 to 2008 it was 6.2. This contrast provides yet one more testament, if such be needed, to the importance of balancing an investment program between stocks and bonds

The longer the time horizon, the less the variability in average annual returns
