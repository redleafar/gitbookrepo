# On Indexing

Basically here there is a historical recap of how index funds were invented. One of the first ones was invented by the author. It was the first index fund available to individual investors

**Indexing Is a Long - Term Strategy**

The S\&P 500 Index Is Not the Market:

That significant differences in annual returns will emerge as large - cap stocks lead or lag the overall market.\
When they lead, the success of the S & P 500 Index will be exaggerated; when they lag, the Index ’ s failure will be exaggerated. **In the long run, however, the differences haven ’ t mattered.**

**Indexing Wins Largely Because of Cost**

Based on data, the skill of portfolio managers, would appear to be largely a matter of luck, a game of chance.

The benefits of a passively managed index fund (compared\
to an actively managed mutual fund) derive largely from the costs incurred by the traditional fund.

**The Index Fund Is Much Better Than It Appears**
