# On Indexing

Basically here there is a historical recap of how index funds were invented. One of the first ones was invented by the author. It was the first index fund available to individual investors

**Indexing Is a Long - Term Strategy**

The S\&P 500 Index Is Not the Market:

That significant differences in annual returns will emerge as large - cap stocks lead or lag the overall market.\
When they lead, the success of the S & P 500 Index will be exaggerated; when they lag, the Index ’ s failure will be exaggerated. **In the long run, however, the differences haven ’ t mattered.**

**Indexing Wins Largely Because of Cost**

Based on data, the skill of portfolio managers, would appear to be largely a matter of luck, a game of chance.

The benefits of a passively managed index fund (compared\
to an actively managed mutual fund) derive largely from the costs incurred by the traditional fund.

**The Index Fund Is Much Better Than It Appears**

**All Index Funds Are Not Created Equal**

Instead of blindly choosing an index fund, investors must be careful to determine that the fund they select is indexed to the market segment they wish to emulate.

The author relies largely on the records of the original two index funds the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, and the Total Stock Market Index Fund. Both are large, free of sale loads and very efficient.

Be sure to read all the fine print about costs in the advertisements, and pay careful heed to the details in the fund’s prospectus

Investors should carefully examine the aspects of each manager ’ s implementation of strategy for any index fund that is being considered

**Indexing Works in All Markets**

Some detractors say that index funds only work in efficient markets but, Ironically, equity indexing should work better in inefficient markets than in efficient markets.

There is a ten years later note very interesting about **ETFs** saying that they are not good, because the main idea with indexing is to have a broad selection. One ETF following the S\&P 500 is reasonable, but most of them have a narrow selection of the stock market. Also they do a lot of trades (high turnover and the idea, as I understand, is to avoid that to reduce the, let's say, transaction fees). Last their expense ratios are high.
