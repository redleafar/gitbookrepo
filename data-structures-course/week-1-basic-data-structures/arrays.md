# Arrays

&#x20;**Array**

Contiguous area of memory consisting of equal-size elements indexed by contiguos integers. Initial index can be 0 or 1 depending on the language.\


Key point of arrays:

* Constant-time access to read and write any particular element in an array. This means we just do arithmetic to figure out the address of a particular element of an array:
* address = array\_addr + elem\_size \* (i-first\_index)

**Multi-Dimensional Arrays**

* For the address you have to count all the number of elements before the position
