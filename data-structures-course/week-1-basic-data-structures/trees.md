# Trees

They show examples for trees applications like sintax tree for a sentence, sintax tree for a mathematical expression, geography hierarchy, animal kingdom, in computer science for representing code

## Binary search tree

&#x20;Two childen at each node.&#x20;

Property of this trees: The value of the root node is greater or equal to all of the nodes in the left child and it's less than the nodes in the right child. (Applies to all nodes)

They show an example with an alfabetically tree.&#x20;

## Definitions&#x20;

A tree is empty, or a node with a key and a list of child trees

Ancestor is a parent or parent of a parent... of a node

Descendants is a child or child of a child... of a node

Sibling: Node that shares the same parent

Leaf: Node with no children

Interior node: Non leaf node (or nodes that do have children)

Level: 1 + num edges between root and node

Height: Maximum depth of subtree node and farthest leaf

Forest: Collection of trees

Node contains: key, children: list of children nodes, parent pointer (optional)

Binary tree: node contains: key, left child, right child, parent pointer (optional)

They show examples of recursive methods to find the height and the size of a tree.
